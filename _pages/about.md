I am a PhD student at the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Interactive Artificial Intelligence at The University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/2020/doctoral/phd-interactive-artificial-intelligence/). My research interests include Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Signal Procesing (audio, speech). I'm particularly interested in self-supervised and representation learning for audio-visual data. My supervisor is [Professor Dima Damen](http://people.cs.bris.ac.uk/~damen/) and I am a member of the [Machine Learning and Computer Vision group](https://uob-mavi.github.io/)

Previously I was at The University of Edinburgh where I completed my MSc in Data Science under [Professor Amos Storkey](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/). I completed my BSc in Computer Science at The University of Hull, and was supervised by [Dr Darryl Davis](https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/darryl-davis).

## Interests
I love learning new stuff. My main interests outside of academia are self-hosting, and  Brazillian Jiu Jitsu. I self-host multiple services on my local network, from media servers to ad blockers. I also do some climbing, powerlifiting, and running. I also have a long list of previous hobbies that I'm still interesting in, including juggling, basketball, and 3d puzzles (think Rubik's cubes), although these are on the backburner for now. Hit me up if we have any shared interests, I'm always looking to learn new skills.
